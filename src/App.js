You and BLACK further agree that the arbitrator will have the exclusive power to rule on his or her jurisdiction, including, without limitation, any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the Agreement to Arbitrate, or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court.

Notwithstanding the preceding, a party may disclose information to the extent that disclosure may be required to fulfil a legal duty, protect, or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings. This confidentiality provision will survive the termination of these Terms and any arbitration brought under these Terms.

</li><br/>
    <li>Class Action Waiver<br/>
You and BLACK agree that any claims relevant to these Terms, or your relationship with BLACK will be brought against the other party in arbitration on an individual basis only and not as a plaintiff or class member in a purported class or representative action.
